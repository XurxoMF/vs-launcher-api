# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

VS Launcher API will be updated frequently to add new features, fix issues and
add compatibility with the latest Vintage Story versions.

To make everything work as expected users will need the latest version so
only that one will be 100% supported and will work as expected.

Issues with old versions will be discarded if they are solved on the latest
version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find any bug or vinerability create a new issue on the Issues tab
or report it to the Launcher API creator at xurxomf@xurxomf.xyz.
